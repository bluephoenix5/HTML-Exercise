    <p>I want to make a website dedicated to all things sci-fi and fantasy. That is my favorite genre of books as well as movies/tv shows.
    <p>Within that there are many subgenres that can be explored as well. This website will explore all of those subgenres and go into detail about the differences.</p> 
    <p>There will also be a list of books, movies, and tv shows for each subgenre so that it's easy to find what you are looking for.</p>
